# Gem in a Strong Box

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/zendesk/geminastrongbox.svg)

Gem in a Strong Box is a Ruby on Rails application that wraps [Gem in a Box](https://github.com/geminabox/geminabox).

You get all of the goodness from Gem in a Box with some added features:

* Protected Gem server to prevent outsiders from accessing your gems.
* A simple front-end to manage the users that have access to your gems.
* Google authentication on the front-end

## Installing and Running

```
git clone https://github.com/zendesk/geminastrongbox.git
cd geminastrongbox
bundle install
rails s
```

Getting the basic server running locally is very easy. Simply clone the repository, bundle the dependencies, and run the server.

### Running in Production

If you want to run Gem in a Stong Box in prodcution, you probably want to make a few changes. Here are my suggestions:

1. Use a different database. Per default Gem in a Strong Box uses a SQLite database. This is simply for ease of development and test. In production I would use a MySQL or PostgreSQL server. Just change the configuration in `config/database.yml` and add the appropriate gem to the `Gemfile`.
2. Set __all__ of the configuration options listed below.

## Configuration

Configuration is done via environment variables

Variable Name          | Description
---------------------- | -------------
`SECRET_KEY_BASE`      | Ruby on Rails uses this to encrypt sessions and cookies.
`DATA_PATH`            | The path where the hosted gems should be stored.
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`     | The client id obtained from Google.
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | The client secret obtained from Google.
`GOOGLE_DOMAIN`        | The domain that should have access to your gems. Only users with an email on this domain will have access to your gems.
